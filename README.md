# Setting-up-your-virtualization-environment

The lecture materials walked you through how to make a new Virtual Machine for a Linux-based system. Your assignment is to create a detailed document from scratch that outlines the complete process from start to end the creation of a VM. Utilizing the resources given to you create a Windows 10 Education Edition VM that's capable of accessing the internet. Remember that you have direct access to licensed products through ASU; you can find this information listed under tools in the Welcome section in this class.

Deliverables:

A detailed document containing screenshots and short blurbs at each step identifying each step of the process.
Document any non-standard settings you chose to utilize and details as to why you chose them.
Validation that your VM can ultimately reach the internet by including a screenshot of your ASU homepage at https://my.asu.edu with your name visible.
